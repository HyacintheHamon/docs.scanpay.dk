  <h1>Security</h1>
  <p>
    Security is very important to us. If you have any security concerns or issues, please disclose this information directly to <a href="mailto:security@scanpay.dk">security@scanpay.dk</a>. Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been handled by the security team.
  </p>

  {{ h(2, "Basic authentication", "") }}
  <p>
    We support Basic authentication with API keys as credentials. All your API requests must include an <code class="code">authorization</code> header with your base64-encoded API key. Like this:

    <code class="pcode"><span class="hljs-attr">Authorization</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Basic "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">base64_encode(</span>apikey<span class="hljs-built_in">)</span></code>
  </p>

  {{ h(2, "Transport Layer Security", "") }}
  <p>
    For security reasons, we only support Transport Layer Security version 1.2 (TLSv1.2).

    use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), SHA-2 certificates.

     Below is a list of ciphers we can currently guarantee support for.
